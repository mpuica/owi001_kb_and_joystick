# owi001_kb_and_joystick
Controlling the Arduino and OWI arm project with either a keyboard or a Loghitech Attack 3 joystick.

### Update 005 
The version owi01_005 is linux based (Ubuntu) 
and is refactored for Processing 3 
with the new version of the former proControll library (called now Game Control Plus)

### Dependecies 
require to add Game Controll Plus library (former proControll)

### Install
load the .ino file into ARDUINO IDE and upload it on your board ARDUINO MEGA (should work for other arduino boards, but try it on your own risk). 

load the .pde file into processing add Pro Control Plus and run the application.

### Disclaimer
This is hardcoded to work with Logitech Attack 3 joystick.
To make it work with another game controller you have to identifiy and eventualy map
your controller in the code.

If you need help drop me a line and I shure will be more than happy to give you a hand.

###TODO
eventualy automap or select the game controller
